Hi!

Welcome to the Pokemon_Python repository. This is a simple project in which I will be
attempting to simulate a single battle between two pokemon teams. I plan to use this
project to enhance my skills with the Python language. This could probably be better
done in Java, but since this is only for practice, it is of no consequence. I suppose there
is not much to say in this README file.
